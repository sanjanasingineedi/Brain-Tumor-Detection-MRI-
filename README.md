# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to accurately detects and classifies brain tumors from MRI scans, reducing diagnostic time and enhancing precision through automated analysis.

---

## 📖 Overview

Thist aims to automate the process of brain tumor detection using a deep learning model based on CNN architecture. It takes MRI scan images as input, processes them through a trained network, and classifies them into tumor or non-tumor categories. The system enhances diagnostic reliability and reduces human error.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the notebook or script**

Open `tumor_detection.ipynb` or run `app.py` for prediction.

## 📊 Dataset

MRI images used in this project are pre-labeled into tumor and non-tumor categories. You can download public datasets from sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or use your own.

---

## 🎯 Results

The CNN model was trained and tested with high accuracy and minimal false positives. Visualizations of predictions and confusion matrix are included in the notebook.

---

## 🧪 Challenges Faced

- Handling noisy or low-resolution MRI images
- Balancing dataset for training stability
- Fine-tuning the model to reduce overfitting

---

## ✅ What’s Next

- Integrate model into a web app for live usage
- Improve classification into tumor types
- Deploy using Flask or Streamlit
